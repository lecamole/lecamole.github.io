# Hello!

My name is Camila Angulo. I am an astrophysics MSc student at Instituto de Astronomía in Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. 

I am mainly insterested in GRB afterglows and optical GW counterparts. I really like observational astronomy! 

I have a BSc in Astronomy from Universidad Autónoma de Sinaloa. 

Outside of academia, I really enjoy watching TV series and cool movies that leave me feeling like *???*. I specially love when I watch weird movies with my friends. 

I adore cats and have 4 of them:

* Gato
